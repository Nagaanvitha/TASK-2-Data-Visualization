# Data Cleaning:

Dropping columns like Cabin, handling missing values in Age and Embarked.

Removing duplicates and checking for nulls.

# EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):

Great visualizations using both seaborn and plotly.express—makes trends easier to spot.

You covered survival by gender, class, age, fare, and embarked port.

# Feature Engineering:

Dropping unnecessary columns like PassengerId, Name, Ticket.

Encoding categorical features with LabelEncoder.

# Modeling & Evaluation:

Scaling features with StandardScaler.

# Training and evaluating multiple models: LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, XGBoost.

Using a custom evaluation function for consistent model assessment.

# How Your Models Performed
You’re evaluating on:

Train/Test accuracy

Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

Confusion matrix

This gives you a well-rounded view of performance. If you want, you can also look into:

ROC AUC Curve

Precision-Recall Curve

Cross-validation (for more robust metrics)

# Suggestions for Enhancement
Hyperparameter Tuning: Try GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for models like Random Forest or XGBoost.

Feature Engineering:

You might extract features from names (e.g., titles like Mr., Mrs., etc.).

Create a new feature combining SibSp and Parch into FamilySize.

Missing Value Handling (Enhancement): Instead of filling Embarked with just the mode:

python
Copy
Edit
df['Embarked'].fillna(df['Embarked'].mode()[0], inplace=True)
Class Imbalance (Optional): If you find survival classes imbalanced, consider:

class_weight='balanced' in Logistic Regression or Decision Trees

Over/undersampling techniques (SMOTE, etc.)
